	+ One fun fact about yourself
- Setting expectations 

## Overview 
- What is data? 
- What is data science? 
- Real life examples 
- Careers in data science

## Understanding the domain 
- **Data collection**  
- **Data analysis** - exploratory, descriptive/diagnostic analysis  
- **Data engineering** - predictive/prescriptive analysis  
- **Data science** - Advanced including deep learning, complex algorithms, leading a data science team  


## Tools/Skills    
- **Excel/Spreadsheet application**

## What you will learn  
- Python - core language construct   
	+ ```{python} 
		print('Hello world')
	```
- Basic statistics  
	+ $$ \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum (x-\bar{x})^2} $$
- Machine Learning 
	+ Regression, Classification, Random Forests, Principal Component Analysis, Ensemble, Natural Language Processing

- SQL (*SQLAlchemy*)  
- Visualization software (*Metabase*)  
- Statistical packages

## Who will benefit from this course? 
- First timers 
- Career people
- Academics/researchers 
- People giving data science a second chance
- What will you benefit?

##  Personal Portfolio/Project  
- Everyone will be expected to create a GitHub account 
- Come up with a project of interest  
- Keep your reusable code stored in private git repositories  
- Keep your portfolio in public repositories

## Housekeeping  
- Class days 
- Start times  
- Duration 
- Recording of classes 
- **Our tools**
	+ Python  
	+ Anaconda3
	+ Jupyter Notebook - great IDE! for displaying code while teaching   
	+ Spyder - optional IDE  
	+ GitHub - for your codes and projects along with GitHub gists  
	+ Slack - for interaction and video recordings 
	+ Kaggle - primary data source  
	+ Visual Studio Code 

## Housekeeping (contd)
- There will be no graded homework 
- There will be simple tasks at the end of every other class
