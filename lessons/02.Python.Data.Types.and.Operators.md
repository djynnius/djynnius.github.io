## Learning Objectives  
- Understand the core components of programming languages  
- Understand the core construct of python  
- Understand data types in python and be able to name and describe them  
- Understanding how data types in python map to data types in data science  
- Understanding operators and operator types  
- Introduce two functions  
	+ print  
	+ type  


## Learning a new programing language  
- Simple rule(cheat)  
	+ Data types  
	+ Operators  
	+ Control structure logic  
	+ Control structure loops  
	+ Functions (in built and user-defined)  
	+ Object-oriented programing (OOP)  


## What is Python  
- Object-oriented Language 
- In python (almost) everything is an object  
- Data types have 'methods' that are unique to their type  
- Python has a limited set of functions and instead of functions uses methods mostly
- Version 2 vs **Version 3**


## Learning Python  
- Follow the same rules for learning a new language just described!


## Data Types 
- Strings   
- Integers  
- Floats  
- None  
- Boolean  
- Collections  
	+ Tuples  
	+ Lists  
	+ Dictionaries  
	+ Sets


## Strings  
- Characters of any type and any length wrapped in quotes that may be single or double
```python
print("Hello world")
print('Hello world')
```
- Some string methods  
```python
"Hello world".lower()
"Hello world".upper()
"hello world".capitalize()
```


## Integers  
- Integers are simply whole numbers  
- Examples 1, 2, 10, 55 ...


## Floats  
- Floats are decimal numbers and may include whole numbers with decimal place  
- Example - 1.2, 4.73, 5.0, 7.00  


## Booleans  
- A fancy name for True or False  
- Notice they are not wrapped in quotes. That would make them strings!  
- Examples - True, False  
```python
True  
False 
```

## None Type  
- Simply nothing!  
- Same as NULL in some other languages  
- Written as 
```python
None
```

## Collections   
- As the name implies a mix of different things put together  
- 0 indexed (you count them from zero, not one)  
	+ Tuples - once set cannot be changed formed with brackets     
	+ Lists - Like tuples but can be changed (modified) formed with square brackets      
	+ Sets - Like tuples but with no duplicates formed with curly braces  

```python
days = ('monday', 'tuesday', 'wednesday', 'thursday', 'friday', 'saturday', 'sunday') #tuple  
basket = ['mango', 'banana', 'guava', 'orange', 'guava', 'pineapple', 'guava'] #list  
fruits = {'mango', 'banana', 'guava', 'orange', 'pineapple'} #set

print(days[0])
print(basket[1])
```

## Collections (contd.)  
- Dictionaries - Key value pairs   
```python
details = {'name': 'Adamu Okechuckwu Adewumi', 'age': 35, 'sex': 'male'}

print(details['name'])
print(details['age'])
print(details['sex'])

```

## Collections (contd.)  
- Special collections  
	+ Series  
	+ NumPy Arrays (2-dimensional arrays)  
	+ Pandas Data frames (collections that are like spreadsheets)


## Data primitives in Data Science  and how they map to Python Data Types
- Qualitative AKA Categorical AKA Character (Strings, Booleans)    
- Quantitative AKA Numeric (Floats, Integers)  
- Data science deals broadly with these 2 types only  
- If data is missing that would map to None  


## Operators  
- These are symbols that carry out some assigned function  
- The assignment operator (=) 
- Mathematical operators (+, -, /, * , ** , %)  
- The concatenation operator (+)  
- Comparison operators (==, >, <, >=, <=, !=, is, is not)  
- Logical operators (and, or)  
- Object oriented programing operator (.)  


## The assignment operator =
```python 
a = 1 
firstname = 'Danladi'  
fruits = ['guava', 'orange', 'banana']
```  

## Mathematical operators + - / * ** %
```python
#assign data to variables
a = 2 
b = 3 
c = 'Hello'

#Mathematical operators
a + b #addition
a - b #subtraction
a / b #division
a * d #multiplication 
a ** d #exponent 
a % b #modulus(remainder)

```  
- There is operator precedence (PEDMAS)
	+ Parenthesis (Bracket)
	+ Exponent (Power)  
	+ Division  
	+ Multiplication  
	+ Addition  
	+ Subtraction  


## The concatenation operator +  
- Plus(+) when used between strings joins them  
```python
c + c #concatenation
```

## Comparison operators (==, >, <, >=, <=, !=, is, is not, in, not in)  
- Comparison operators return a Boolean as a result  
- for equality, we use the double equality symbol since the single one is reserved for assignment  
```python
#assigning variables
x = 4 
y = 5 
i = 1 
j = 1 
z = x
fruits = ['mango', 'guava', 'orange']

#testing comparison operators
x == y 
i == j
x > y 
x < y 
x >= y 
x <= y 
x != y 
x is y 
x is not y 
i is j
i is not j 
x is z

'mango' in fruits
'mango' not in fruits 
'pineapple' in fruits 
'pineapple' not in fruits

```


## Logical operators (and, or)  
- This lets you evaluate multiple Booleans and get a single Boolean 
- Seeing an example will make it easier to understand  
```python
#simple boolean comparison
True and True
True and False 
False and False
True or True
True or False 
False or False

(True and True) or (True or False) 

((x == y) and ('mango' in fruits)) or (z > y)

```


## Object-oriented operator  . 
- This is simply a dot (.)  
- We have seen this already when we accessed string methods  
```python 
#simple list methods
fruits = ['mango', 'apple']
fruits.append('guava')

name = 'okokomaiko'
name.lower()
name.upper()
name.capitalize()

```


## Useful to know  
- White space in python  
- Writing comments in python  
- We have seen variables, some other languages have constants but python doesn't have that in its current construct    
- f-strings

```python
name = 'Stephen'  
print(f"Hello {name}")
```


## Gist of the day  
- [Data Types and Operators](https://gist.github.com/djynnius/63d5a3a5f855e921a979dccc288dec38)  
- [PDF version of this module](./02.Python.Data.Types.and.Operators.pdf)   
- The Jupyter Notebook will be shared over **Slack**  


## Homework  
- Install the git client on your computer  
- Windows users can get it from the [git scm](https://git-scm.com/downloads) site 
- Linux and Mac users should have git client already installed on their computer  


## Housekeeping  
- We have named one of the channels **#homework** and this can be used for all conversations about the homework between classes  
- The **#data-science-with-python** will be for videos and materials including Jupyter Notebook files and other codes  
- **#general** can be used for other conversations that is not homework related  
- **#random** can be used for all other conversation including things not related to data science :-)  


## Conclusion 
- Let's go over our learning objectives again 
	+ Understand the core components of programming languages  
	+ Understand the core construct of python  
	+ Understand data types in python and be able to name and describe them  
	+ Understanding how data types in python map to data types in data science  
	+ Understanding operators and operator types
