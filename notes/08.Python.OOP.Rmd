## Objectives  
- Understand the concept of Object Oriented Programing  
- Understand classes  
- Understand objects  
- Understand attributes  
- Understand methods  

## Object Oriented Programing (OOP) Conceptually  
- Think for a moment how coding feels a lot like writing tons of incomprehensible text  
- Imagine a world where programming doest have to be incomprehensible  
- Also imagine where components much like in real life are fitted together  
- That world exists  
- Everything can be thought of as objects  

## Classes: the blueprint  
- To have objects they have to come from a blueprint or mold  
- In architecture thereâ€™s a plan  
- These are used to create multiple objects that look the same and act the same in their core  
- They may have differences in attributes such as location, color, etc but at the core, they are all the same because they come from the same mold  
- These moulds are classes  
```python  
person1 = Student('David', 'Lee', 'Melbourne, Australia')
person2 = Student('Ahmed', 'Ali', 'Doha, Qatar')


university1 = School('University of Lagos', 'tertiary')
university2 = School('Oxford University')

person1.current_school = university2
person2.current_school = university1


person1.enroll(university1, 'Space Technology')
person1.enroll(university2, 'Strategic Studies')
person2.enroll(university1, 'Economics')


print(person1.get_schools())
print(person1.get_courses())

print(person2.current_school.get_students())

```

## Objects: instances of classes  
- Objects are instances of classes  
- There can be multiple objects that are instances of a class  
- Each object is an entity of its own  
- Objects have attributes - things that make them unique  
- Objects have methods  - things that they can do or can be done to them  

## Practical examples  
- dir() and help() methods  
- Strings  
- Lists  
- Dictionaries  

## Review of Objectives  
- Understand the concept of Object Oriented Programing  
- Understand classes  
- Understand objects  
- Understand attributes  
- Understand methods
